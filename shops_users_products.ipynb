It has 12 beaded beads* in a semi-matte pistachio green, dark gray/soft black Swarovski pearl accent beads, sterling silver spacers, a sterling silver toggle clasp, and a teardrop-shaped yellow turquoise (also called turpentine) pendant. The pendant has lots of beautiful natural design and has a slightly matte finish to match the beaded beads. The necklace (not including the drop of the pendant) measures nearly 16\" (40 cm) long. The pendant is 1\" across at its widest (2.5 cm) &amp; hangs approx. 2.25\" (5.5 cm) down from the wire. In the photo, it looks like there is a crack in the pendant. It is a natural groove in the stone &amp; is not damaged in any way. The color is one of the hottest this year, so all you need to do is wear it with black, &amp; you will be right in style. *I have been making these beaded beads for a number of years now &amp; have become absolutely addicted to them!

       "0        This one-of-a-kind necklace is from my signature line. It has 12 beaded beads* in a semi-matte pistachio green, dark gray/soft black Swarovski pearl accent beads, sterling silver spacers, a sterling silver toggle clasp, and a teardrop-shaped yellow turquoise (also called turpentine) pendant. The pendant has lots of beautiful natural design and has a slightly matte finish to match the beaded beads. The necklace (not including the drop of the pendant) measures nearly 16\" (40 cm) long. The pendant is 1\" across at its widest (2.5 cm) & hangs approx. 2.25\" (5.5 cm) down from the wire. In the photo, it looks like there is a crack in the pendant. It is a natural groove in the stone & is not damaged in any way. The color is one of the hottest this year, so all you need to do is wear it with black, & you will be right in style. *I have been making these beaded beads for a number of years now & have become absolutely addicted to them!

It has 16 beaded beads* in a shiny peach/salmon color, matching freshwater pearl accent beads, sterling silver spacers, a sterling silver toggle clasp, and a round shell disc pendant (by LillyPilly Designs) into which an intricate design has been carved. The pendant has subtle shading and really picks up the color of the beaded beads. The necklace measures approximately 16\" (40.6 cm) long from end to end. The pendant hangs approximately 1\" (2.5 cm) from a silver bail. The photos don't do justice to this piece. The focal bead is truly beautiful!

       "15       This work was constructed on a papier mache base. String was then applied to form the mussels. After this, a product is applied to seal the string as otherwise it absorbs too much paint. Finally the mussels are painted.

       "16       This abstract painting was inspired by the prolific egg-laying hens I had at the time. This was one of my earlier works where I was exploring the repetition of an object. Somehow when you repeat the same thing many times, it takes on a different meaning. I was staring into a basket of eggs which my hens had kindly laid for me and this painting was the result. 2' x 2'4\" - oil on unframed canvas This painting is ready for hanging. It is not framed but the sides have been painted so it's not necessary. PLEASE NOTE: The painting pictured is now sold so a similar one will be painted for you.

Autodidacte, j'aspire à partager ma passion. Je travaille principalement avec des perles de verre ayant une préférence pour le verre de Bohème et les perles Miyuki. J'aime malgré tout mélanger les genres et marier de la nacre et du bois avec le verre. J'élabore également des bijoux en mosaïque à partir d'émaux, de cabochons, de crackle et de glitters.

Mes objets sont cousus avec amour et rigueur (beaucoup des deux !) et je prends grand soin à la qualité des objets finis ainsi qu'à celle des matériaux utilisés. Dans cette boutique vous pouvez choisir d'offrir (ou de vous offrir) un objet unique, durable et sorti directement de mon atelier maison. J'imagine, dessine, patronne, illustre et enfin fabrique en séries limitées des sacs, trousses, pochettes et petits objets textiles derrière la marque ZigZag by Nancy. Je propose des objets plein de couleur. Je travaille systématiquement par assemblage de matières couleurs et textures (pas moins de quatre par pièce), beaucoup de fleurs et des pois en toute saison, une grande place à la mercerie (rubans, perles, boutons fantaisie). J'ai un plaisir immense à produire et intégrer les illustrations des mes personnages Pom et Tina dans mes créations, souve...   \n",

En effet, la culture urbaine et le street art ont été mon berceau. Grand passionné, j'ai décidé en 2015 de concrétiser mon affection pour le graphisme et l'illustration en devenant autodidacte sous l'alias de RUGGED.

Each piece that I sell was carefully selected by me. They do not look alike and may come from different decades (from 60' to 90'), but they all expect someone who will put them in values and takes care of them. The selection of my clothing is diverse and varied, many colors and patterns but also essential basics. Some pieces are handmade and you can also find luxury brands such as Hugo Boss. Fews accessories are also proposed. Is aimed at both men and women although many pieces are unisex.

I'm lucky to have a patch of land with natural springs where I let the wildflowers grow ... me and the kids marvel at the wild life this attracts, and my honey bees love it too! Soon I will be selling my own homemade beeswax products for your vintage leather, wood and metal! We live in a 100 year old stone Farmhouse completely crammed with vintage and recycled objects, plus the odd bird's nest or deer horn which I happily stumble across from time to time and can't leave behind! My lovely French neighbour, Jean (also an avid hoarder!), is a master craftsman and finds and restores the many beautiful vintage tools and hardware items for sale at QueenBee.

The weekends find me sifting through the stands and tables of the brocantes and vide greniers (flea markets) in the area, trying to unearth some antique lace, a bit of silk thread, skillfully embroidered vintage linens, inspiring books, sewing tools and other fragments of history to add grace and style to this life in the 21st century.

       "      <td>ADOPTEZ LA GREEN ATTITUDE ! Au départ, la volonté de créer une ligne de vêtements pour les petits et les grands mais comme on dit, « petit à petit l'oiseau fait son nid ». Me voilà à nouveau dans la réalité, d'où le choix de créer pour commencer des Tee Shirt pour enfants de 3 à 10 ans. Je vous expose mon projet qui va bien au delà d'une simple marque de fringues. C'est tout un idéal que je souhaiterais y englober, celui de sensibiliser les enfants à notre environnement à travers les personnages que j'ai créé, Zaza pour les filles et Didi pour les garçons. C'est pourquoi mes Tee Shirt sont 100% coton BIO, gamme douce pour la peau et respectueuse de l'environnement. Étant une nouvelle entreprise Mari's.A sait qu'il est nécessaire de se pencher sur des solutions durables.</td>\n",

       "3      I'm a Northern Irish Mum, going solo with my kids and my bees in the wild and beautiful \"Plateau de Millevaches\" region of Limousin, Central France. I'm lucky to have a patch of land with natural springs where I let the wildflowers grow ... me and the kids marvel at the wild life this attracts, and my honey bees love it too! Soon I will be selling my own homemade beeswax products for your vintage leather, wood and metal! We live in a 100 year old stone Farmhouse completely crammed with vintage and recycled objects, plus the odd bird's nest or deer horn which I happily stumble across from time to time and can't leave behind! My lovely French neighbour, Jean (also an avid hoarder!), is a master craftsman and finds and restores the many beautiful vintage tools and hardware items for sale at QueenBee.

Je réalise des albums photos, des faire-parts (mariage, naissance, baptême...), des cartes pour toute occasion (anniversaire, naissance, fête des pères / mères, départ en retraite etc.), des ballotins de dragées, des marque-places, des boîtes originales pour offrir des petits cadeaux... Ce qui me plaît avant tout, c'est de faire plaisir ! J'aime aussi \"surprendre\" en fabriquant des cartes originales (cartes pop Up, cartes 3D... ou avec un ptit mécanisme inattendu...). Je suis aussi démonstratrice Stampin Up! , ce qui me permet de partager ma passion en animant des ateliers de scrap'. J'adore !!   \n",

Puis, il y a huit ans, me suis lancée comme DA free-lance à Paris. Insatiable globe-trotteuse, je poursuis mon tour du monde (cette fois imaginaire) en créant des cartes géographiques pour mes deux enfants (je les conçoit moi-même car je ne trouve pas de cartes murales actualisées dans un style vintage à mon goût!). Je décide finalement de fonder en 2016 le studio de création \"Émile en ville\" pour partager mes réalisations cartographiques. J'éditerai donc périodiquement une carte murale déco/éducative \"made in France\" (à retrouver sur la e-boutique Etsy).   \n",

Au départ, la volonté de créer une ligne de vêtements pour les petits et les grands mais comme on dit, « petit à petit l'oiseau fait son nid ». Me voilà à nouveau dans la réalité, d'où le choix de créer pour commencer des Tee Shirt pour enfants de 3 à 10 ans. Je vous expose mon projet qui va bien au delà d'une simple marque de fringues. C'est tout un idéal que je souhaiterais y englober, celui de sensibiliser les enfants à notre environnement à travers les personnages que j'ai créé, Zaza pour les filles et Didi pour les garçons. C'est pourquoi mes Tee Shirt sont 100% coton BIO, gamme douce pour la peau et respectueuse de l'environnement. Étant une nouvelle entreprise Mari's.A sait qu'il est nécessaire de se pencher sur des solutions durables.   \n",

Mon travail de juriste est précis et cadré. En tissant, je mobilise une autre energie, j'explore un univers créatif et coloré...Et ça me fait un bien fou! J'adore mixer les matières et les couleurs. J'aime combiner des matériaux bruts et de plus précieux comme la soie. J'espère que vous apprécierez la visite! Je peux également réaliser des pièces personnalisees sur demande.

Of Greek origin but self exiled in Southern France countryside for almost a decade now, she developed her unique and original designs under the labels \"Coup de grâce\" and \"Orichalque\" with a growing success in France and many fanatic customers. This is a small artisan business entirely ran by one single person. There's lots of research, commitment, passion and love into it. Enjoy!   \n",

J'ai passé mon enfance dans l'atelier de couture de ma mère, et même si je n'ai pas son talent, le corps de ces poupées est assez simple à habiller ...et me rendent joyeuse.

The weekends find me sifting through the stands and tables of the brocantes and vide greniers (flea markets) in the area, trying to unearth some antique lace, a bit of silk thread, skillfully embroidered vintage linens, inspiring books, sewing tools and other fragments of history to add grace and style to this life in the 21st century.

Puis, il y a huit ans, me suis lancée comme DA free-lance à Paris. Insatiable globe-trotteuse, je poursuis mon tour du monde (cette fois imaginaire) en créant des cartes géographiques pour mes deux enfants (je les conçoit moi-même car je ne trouve pas de cartes murales actualisées dans un style vintage à mon goût!). Je décide finalement de fonder en 2016 le studio de création \"Émile en ville\" pour partager mes réalisations cartographiques.

Me voilà à nouveau dans la réalité, d'où le choix de créer pour commencer des Tee Shirt pour enfants de 3 à 10 ans. Je vous expose mon projet qui va bien au delà d'une simple marque de fringues. C'est tout un idéal que je souhaiterais y englober, celui de sensibiliser les enfants à notre environnement à travers les personnages que j'ai créé, Zaza pour les filles et Didi pour les garçons. C'est pourquoi mes Tee Shirt sont 100% coton BIO, gamme douce pour la peau et respectueuse de l'environnement.

Je réalise des albums photos, des faire-parts (mariage, naissance, baptême...), des cartes pour toute occasion (anniversaire, naissance, fête des pères / mères, départ en retraite etc.), des ballotins de dragées, des marque-places, des boîtes originales pour offrir des petits cadeaux... Ce qui me plaît avant tout, c'est de faire plaisir ! J'aime aussi \"surprendre\" en fabriquant des cartes originales (cartes pop Up, cartes 3D... ou avec un ptit mécanisme inattendu...).

Puis, il y a huit ans, me suis lancée comme DA free-lance à Paris. Insatiable globe-trotteuse, je poursuis mon tour du monde (cette fois imaginaire) en créant des cartes géographiques pour mes deux enfants (je les conçoit moi-même car je ne trouve pas de cartes murales actualisées dans un style vintage à mon goût!). Je décide finalement de fonder en 2016 le studio de création \"Émile en ville\" pour partager mes réalisations cartographiques. J'éditerai donc périodiquement une carte murale déco/éducative \"made in France\" (à retrouver sur la e-boutique Etsy).   \n",

Au départ, la volonté de créer une ligne de vêtements pour les petits et les grands mais comme on dit, « petit à petit l'oiseau fait son nid ». Me voilà à nouveau dans la réalité, d'où le choix de créer pour commencer des Tee Shirt pour enfants de 3 à 10 ans. Je vous expose mon projet qui va bien au delà d'une simple marque de fringues. C'est tout un idéal que je souhaiterais y englober, celui de sensibiliser les enfants à notre environnement à travers les personnages que j'ai créé, Zaza pour les filles et Didi pour les garçons. C'est pourquoi mes Tee Shirt sont 100% coton BIO, gamme douce pour la peau et respectueuse de l'environnement. Étant une nouvelle entreprise Mari's.A sait qu'il est nécessaire de se pencher sur des solutions durables.   \n",

Mon travail de juriste est précis et cadré. En tissant, je mobilise une autre energie, j'explore un univers créatif et coloré...Et ça me fait un bien fou! J'adore mixer les matières et les couleurs. J'aime combiner des matériaux bruts et de plus précieux comme la soie. J'espère que vous apprécierez la visite! Je peux également réaliser des pièces personnalisees sur demande.

Of Greek origin but self exiled in Southern France countryside for almost a decade now, she developed her unique and original designs under the labels \"Coup de grâce\" and \"Orichalque\" with a growing success in France and many fanatic customers. This is a small artisan business entirely ran by one single person. There's lots of research, commitment, passion and love into it. Enjoy!   \n",
